# Quantum Walk (QW)

Quantum walk is an quantum analog of [classical random walks](#classicalrandomwalk). It plays the part of building quantum algorithms.


## Problem definition

There are two types of quantum walk:
1. Continous time quantum walk (CTQW)
Given an quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ and an untitary operator $U$, rotate the quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ by the untitary operator $U$.
2. Discrete time quantum walk (DTQW)

#### <a id="classicalrandomwalk" />Def : Classical random walk

Let {$X_1,X_2,...$ } is a sequance of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and this sequance are independent and identically distributed random variables. A random walk started at $z\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a sequence ($S_t$) with $t\geq0$ 

$$\begin{cases} S_t=z& \text{t=0}\\ S_t=S_{t-1}+X_t& \text{t>0} \end{cases}$$ 

The quantities $X_n$ are  referred to the steps of the random walk.

A random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.
