# Quantum Walk (QW)

Quantum walk is an quantum analog of classical random walks. It plays the part of building quantum algorithms.


## Problem definition

There are two types of quantum walk:
1. Continous time quantum walk (CTQW)
Given an quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ and an untitary operator $U$, rotate the quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ by the untitary operator $U$.





3. Discrete time quantum walk (DTQW)
